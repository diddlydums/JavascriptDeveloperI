// The basic syntax of a class declaration is as follows:
class ClassName {
  // The convention is to start the name of the class with a capital letter.
  constructor() {}
  // Adding the constructor is optional.
  method1() {}
  // There should be no comma between class methods.
  method2() {}
  method3() {}
}
// The basic syntax of a class expression is as follows:
// A class expression can be anonymous or named.
// The name is only visible in the scope of the class expression.
let ClassName = class OptionalName {
  constructor() {}
  method1() {}
  method2() {}
  method3() {}
